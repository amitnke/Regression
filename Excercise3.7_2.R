#i. yes, these is a relationship between the predictor and the response by testing the null hypothesis of whether all regression coefficients are zero. 
#The F-static is far from 1(with a small p value). 
#ii. Looking at the p-values associated with each predictorâ€™s t-statistic, we see that displacement, weight, year, and origin have a statistically significant relationship, while cylinders, horsepower, and acceleration do not.
#iii. The regression coefficient for year, 0.7508, suggests that for every one year, mpg increases by the coefficient. In other words, cars become more fuel efficient every year by almost 1 mpg / year.
